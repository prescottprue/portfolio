    "description":"The Pyro Platform is a cloud platform for building beautiful apps powered by realtime data and analytics that allows users of Firebase to quickly add powerful features to their Firebase apps by significantly reducing the design and development required for enabling (a) user management, (b) analytics, (c) push  notifications, (d) logging, (e) data administration, and (f) background jobs. I was inspired to build The Pyro Platform by my experience working with the Severna Park High School computer science club. The goal of Pyro is to lower the barrier of entry for building cross platform applications, thus making programming skills available to every person- regardless of previous experience, education, computer platform, or operating system. 48 Students in the Severna Park High School computer science club were among the first to begin testing the platform. The Pyro Platform consists of two components: (1) a client javascript library (See FireAdmin) that can be dropped in to any app using Firebase, and (2) a frontend that allows developers to manage the operation of those features. Because The Pyro Platform is all on the cloud, the user does not need to install any programs, or operating system in order to use the platform. This along with the inclusion of industry standard/ bleeding edge tools from the start (including ionic, firebase etc.) removes any prep work. The Pyro platform is accessible to developers of all skill levels. Users that are new to programming can get started with the platform by completing hands on tutorials that start at the basics. Advanced users are also comfortable in editor as it adheres to standards put into place by the creators of the advanced frameworks we use within the platform.",

The system, which is still in place, uses information entered into a graphical interface to solve for the placement of all hardware, material, and supports.  Waco Products was my first professional interaction with the combination of software and hardware aspects of engineering. Before this system was implemented, engineering for each liquid control gate would take 6-9 hours. This improvement in efficiency continues to save WACO thousands on engineering costs for each project. The customization is controlled by a user interface where dimensions as well as options for the operator, bolt type, and seal type can be entered. The system then outputs 3D models which are used to automatically generate stress test information as well as engineering drawings for the completely customized product. ",

For each of these metrics (such as revenue growth, gross profit growth, EBIDTA growth, net income growth, gross margin, and EBIDTA margin), small business owners see how their company compares to the rest of the market. Unlike existing financial summary solutions, Escollate also provides an anonymous social platform where users can ask questions about their finances, the state of their business, or anything else that may need clarification by like-minded small business owners. By tapping the \"Ask a Question\" link for a Dashboard item, the user can publish a question about a specific metric with just a few clicks.
