Using my experience with parametric modeling my team and I began to build a web based platform to allow DJs the ability to design their controller withina simple drag and drop interface. After completeing their designs the user would be able to share their designs or order the controller direclty from Basilar.",subCaption:"Go down to view the first controller design"},{image:{url:"img/Basilar/First-Lighting.jpg"},caption:'This design is based on a layout I concived while DJing so it was lovingly named the "Pruvit" controller.'},{image:{url:"img/Basilar/Exposed-Controller.png"},caption:"Spacing of circuitry components is automatically accounted for and wireing is routed to avoid being pinched/cut when being serviced. Modularized design of these components allows users to easy order and replace parts themselves instead of waiting weeks for a factory repair."},{image:{url:"img/Basilar/Stress-Test.png"},caption:"Automated stress testing of support structures is imperative to guarantee control hardware remains intact.

The Pyro platform is our first iteration of this idea that teaches through walking a user through creating their first app. After the click of a button you have a live app with the capability to have users sign up as well as sign in. All of the data generated by these users is availble in realtime from the start. Click down for more details."},{image:{url:"img/Pyro/Pyro-Editor.png"},caption:"The Pyro editor panel allows users to program with every key stroke saved directly to the realtime cloud which means no saving required! We allow our users to go as in depth as they would like by providing hands on tutorials that start at the basics. Even the most advanced users are also comfortable in editor as it adheres to standards put into place by the  creaters of the advanced frameworks we use within the platform."},{image:{url:"img/Pyro/Pyro-Tester.png"},caption:"After programming in the Editor tab you can view your changes to your app right away by going to the tester panel.
